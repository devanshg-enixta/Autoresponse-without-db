I tried to mix it with his regular food to give him a taste of it but no success. Now if you search for a review of this product elsewhere you'd find many not recommending it because it has meat in very less quantity. Not good for carnivorous animals. So i wouldn't recommend this product, nor keep feeding this to your beloved pets to the existing buyers.

So I started adding 1/4th tsp of Psyllium Husk and additional water to it, and that solved it. But then, it requires some effort. If she had just a bite or little bit from it, then either throw the remaining, I mean you can't keep it for ever, or refrigerate it, that also may not be feasible for long. So I ended up wasting quite a bit.With this it's easy, just fill a bowl with this and keep another bowl with water next to it. If she has a little bit, the remainder can still remain in the bowl as it doesn't get spoilt.Overall it costs about Rs.5-6- more than the chicken/fish combo I was giving, but then considering the diet of a cat, it doesn't come to anything substantive.",amzn1.account.AFMILO7LJIIUB3SMXQELZ7ALW2YA,Emron,20.336000000000006,Amazon India,R24VVB9GBEZ0E0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Glad that your pet liked it customer name.

They have a thick, shiny coat and have been keeping good health. It gives a wholesome nutrition and they don't seem to want any other food once they are full. However, like humans even cats tend to get bored, so please offer them some wet food and fish treats from time to time. However this dry food is perfect as a regular meal. Be sure to sprinkle the food with water sometimes to make it moist. Cats are known to consume very less water- which is detrimental to their health (especially liver) and hygiene and also makes their urine more pungent smelling. So ensure that they drink enough water especially in the summer, and one of the best way to do that is to sprinkle some water into this wet food every time they eat, and let it sit for a while till the kibble absorbs the water and becomes soft and moist.Pros of ordering it on Amazon:1. The 7 kg packet is very heavy and mostly unavailable elsewhere, so it's really convenient when Amazon delivers it at your doorstep.2.

I'm not sure if she was a witch or not, but she treated the kittens very badly and fed them on rice and milk.I kidnapped one kitten, and she was in poor health so I took her directly to the Vet.  The vet carried out all necessary treatments for parasites, and then advised me to change the diet immediately.  He recommended the Whiskas Kitten Food, and I changed this to the adult variety as soon as my kitten morphed into a cat.The Vet told me that this Whiskas food is a balanced diet for the cat.  It contains all the required vitamins and minerals a cat requires for a long, healthy life, strong bones and a loud meow.The Whiskas cat food is small biscuits painstakingly sculpted into the shape of fish.  I don't live near the coast, so my cat doesn't even know what a fish looks like, but she loves this food and is very healthy.Because this is a dry food it is MOST IMPORTANT that your cat has free access to drinking water at all times.

I have not changed my initial review to show you how things changed over time. My cats love this product and I was really happy when I saw them eat this. It came to a level where my cats chose not to eat anything other than this and a similar product from another brand. One of my cat unfortunately has been diagnosed with a partial renal failure. His creatine values are very high and I sought opinions from 2-3 different vets. All of them blamed high proteins for these values due the prolonged use of this product. He is on a month long treatment of saline and renal food. Everything else has been stopped and my cat will now be on a permanent diet of renal food. Please don't take this easy way of feeding your cats if you really love and care about them. Consult your vet before using this product. I'm repenting for not doing that. I'm not saying it is bad, but at least the vet will guide you on the quantity and frequency of feeding this to your cats.

This is the worst pet food you can give to any animal.Pedigree Dog Food and Pedigree Cat Food are exactly the same. It contains only Corn and Chemical Artificial Flavours. Neither the dog food nor the cat food of Pedigree contains any meat. It has no chicken, no meat, no ocean fish, no milk. All the products of Pedigree contain ONLY Corn and chemical flavours that fool your pet into eating it.Of course, if you do a simple little bit of study you will find that home made food is best for your dogs and cats and other pets. In case you have no choice, I would suggest Drools FOCUS Puppy Food which has real chicken and is lot more expensive than this corn food. Another option is Royal Canin but it has to be imported so it is even more expensive than Drools.Pedigree is widely advertised with family friendly and cute kids and furry animals on TV and other media. So people think this company cares about pets. They don't. They feed your pets corn and some by products like chicken feet, beak, animal hooves, and other remains which even a stray dog / cat would want to avoid.Think about it. If you buy One Kilo Chicken from your local slaughterhouse even in expensive Mumbai costs maximum Rs. 110. That is 100% chichen weighing One Kilo. Isn't that better than spending Rs. 1000 on corn flavoured to smell like chicken? If you love your pet, try the home made one. If you want emergency stock of pet food when you don't have time for preparing it at home, go for Drools Focus or Royal Canin.",amzn1.account.AFVFGVFOC6WUUL7VZ3ZSBDAFMPOA,Ujjwal Dey,13.377272727272727,Amazon India,R2LCHMYRJ6TLJR,1,Glad that your pet liked it customer name.

I have witnessed a few months back where I use to feed my cats products other than whiskas and I see their development is very slow, but after feeding whiskas for 2 - 3 weeks I notice a lot of change in them, they are more active, happy and playful, their hair quality also changed dramatically from a dull appearance to a shiny, long and healthy one. Whiskas does a lot of good to my cats.I currently have 13 cats of different breed, the method I use when feeding them is that I use to take a cup full of whiskas in a bowl and pour one cup of boiling water over it and cover it leaving it till the boiling water is fully absorbed, them I mixed the now softened whiskas with one plate of rice. I feed them this  way twice a day also I have a separate bowl for giving them water so that they will not drink water from drains when they're thirsty.If you're planning to buy, go for it, I'm sure you'll beginning to see a lot of positive change in your cats.

Between this and other brand that my friend uses for his kitten, I have noticed a much better coat in mine. It can be genetic or from the food, cant really say. Also leaving it in the tray is a problem as it absorbs moisture readily and my kitten doesn't like it once it has taken moisture in. I would suggest you try plain dry food first and sprinkle water only if your kitten absolutely doesn't like the kibble as is. Overall a great product and value for money.

"[all, dog-user-breed, health_impact]","[pedigree, gsd, fur]",0,109710.0,"Hi my dog is 11 years old. First I used to feed my dog with adult pedigree, then I started feeding my dog with royal canin. But I'm not satisfied then I started feeding my dog with pedigree senior. In 1st month I didn't find any difference, but from 2nd month I observed my dog is active than before.

"[all, dog-user-breed, nutrition_ingredientst, pricing]","[amazon, store, local store, part, jelly, purchase]",0,109999.0,"""Cats Know the Difference"" - I have 3 cats who have been feeding on 'Tuna in Jelly' packs and cans since 6 months.When I offered them with this food purchased from Amazon, they just smelled and turned away. None were ready to eat.What I noticed:1. Instead of Jelly, there was liquid in the can.  (Lets assume that, the jelly melted off due to Summer heat).2. That jelly didn't freeze back even after 2 days of refrigeration. Typically, the cans I purchase in a store near by, the jelly solidifies once i put it in AC room.3. The Tuna pieces were different - This was very much noticeable to my eyes.All my observations + the feedback from my cats = DONT BUY. I will not say this is a fake or whatever because, I don't know! My cats are not eating and your cats may not eat too because 'Cats know the difference'.============= Edit on 9th May 2017.Having said above, I wanted to add some more to this review.I got Same cans from my local store.  My cats ate a part of the can and i saved the rest for next session.  By then, all the jelly became liquid and then when i served it to my cats, they refused to eat.So, I learnt that, once the jelly in the can melts off, cats wont like the stuff.Unfortunately, in all the cans that I got from Amazon, the jelly is already in liquid state and I believe, that should be the reason they are not eating it.",amzn1.account.AGOEGESJ7IWYTUXYGMRROVKJDIWA,Ram Babu Gorre,-30.97894736842105,Amazon India,R1VVDEVFQHY1OO,1.0 out of 5 stars,"DearRam Babu Gorre, We apologize for the inconvenience caused.
