DO NOT BUY, IF YOU WANT YOUR DOG TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION. this is not a good/genuine product. My dog fell ill after eating this. I thought its not because of the product, probably some other thing caused him the illness. But when he was OK, I started feeding him pedigree from the same bag and again he was ill. He suffered from diarrhea and that too in severe condition.After the tests were conducted, my Vet asked me to stop feeding this product. Shameful act by Amazon and by the seller.\"\n",

      "1. i dont know about 5 signs of good health but this contains many of the micro and macro nutrients which is essential for a dog. supplementing this with some milk, and raw eggs cooked ragi.2. i bought this mainly because we had to cook ragi too often. this helps extend the frequency by which we cook ragi.3. its good enough. i like the smell. i can confidently say that if i were a dog i would be all over this.4. i ordered a 10kg pack. its particularly difficult to preserve the freshness for more than a month. pedigree should reinvent the way we use this. maybe give it an airtight flap in the bottom from which the food can be removed.5. feeding the dog only this would be a costly affair. hence we use half pedigree and half home made food like ragi.its a good product. i would recommend it to people who struggle to prepare food very frequently. helps you feed nutritious food for your best friend\n",

I was almost about to replace pedigree with home meal for dinber as well and just thought of mixing pedigree. Now she shows interest in eating it.Hope u people make it interesting for dogs to eat.\n",

      "Dear honey, Your input will help us, thanks for writing. Please take care of your pet's stomach. At pedigree, we go through intensive tests and processes before launching the product, the bad stomach might be due to some other things.  Food allergies in pets are relatively rare and are estimated to account for less than 10% of all allergies. However, in the same way that some people cannot tolerate certain dietary components such as wheat gluten or cows milk protein, a small number of pets have allergies or dietary sensitivity to foods such as beef, wheat or dairy.

      "Dear Amazon Customer, thanks for your valuable feedback. We are happy that the product could reach your expectations.No single ingredient/ source of diet will provide all the nutrients and energy requirement of a dog. For eg., Cereals are rich in some vitamins but lack many nutrients required for a dog or puppy. Meat is rich source of proteins but low in Calcium and Vitamin A. Like wise Milk is low in iron and Vitamin D. Dogs can not tolerate too much of milk in their diet. A 7 kg body weight dog can tolerate up to 250 ml of milk and anything excess lead to loose stools. Raw eggs should not be fed to dogs as it can lead to poor skin and hair coat. Nutrients like biotin are not utilized in the body. Raw eggs are also source of infections like salmonella which can cause severe gastroenteritis in dogs.  Your input will help us, thanks for writing. Regards, Team Pedigree\n",

      "Dear Amazon Customer, thanks for your valuable feedback. We are happy that the product could reach your expectations.No single ingredient/ source of diet will provide all the nutrients and energy requirement of a dog. For eg., Cereals are rich in some vitamins but lack many nutrients required for a dog or puppy. Meat is rich source of proteins but low in Calcium and Vitamin A. Like wise Milk is low in iron and Vitamin D. Dogs can not tolerate too much of milk in their diet. A 7 kg body weight dog can tolerate up to 250 ml of milk and anything excess lead to loose stools. Raw eggs should not be fed to dogs as it can lead to poor skin and hair coat. Nutrients like biotin are not utilized in the body. Raw eggs are also source of infections like salmonella which can cause severe gastroenteritis in dogs.  We appreciate you taking time to write to us. Regards, Team Pedigree\n",

      "Dear Amazon Customer, Thanks for taking time in providing the feedback. I would suggest you to select which type of food will suit your dog. Here are few guidelines:  Your dog's calorie and nutrient requirements are based on his body weight, his age, his physiological state (growing, pregnant or lactating?) and his activity level. First select the right type of food for his lifestyle, then weigh your dog (don't guess) and feed according to the feeding guide provided with the food. It is, however, important to remember that all dogs are individuals and feeding guides are recommendations only. So, most importantly, monitor your dog's body condition and weight regularly, adjusting the amount you are feeding to ensure that body weight and condition are optimum so that he is neither losing nor gaining weight.

      "Dear Anant Singh Negi, thanks for your valuable feedback. We are happy that the product could reach your expectations.No single ingredient/ source of diet will provide all the nutrients and energy requirement of a dog. For eg., Cereals are rich in some vitamins but lack many nutrients required for a dog or puppy. Meat is rich source of proteins but low in Calcium and Vitamin A. Like wise Milk is low in iron and Vitamin D. Dogs can not tolerate too much of milk in their diet. A 7 kg body weight dog can tolerate up to 250 ml of milk and anything excess lead to loose stools. Raw eggs should not be fed to dogs as it can lead to poor skin and hair coat. Nutrients like biotin are not utilized in the body. Raw eggs are also source of infections like salmonella which can cause severe gastroenteritis in dogs.  Your feedback will definitely help us, thanks for writing. Regards, Team Pedigree\n",

A few hints to avoid or decrease hair shedding incorporates:   1. Brush, brush, brush : A day by day brushing works best since it disposes of the majority of your pooch's free hair. On the off chance that you can't brush him consistently, go for no less than two great brushings for every week. 2. Give him a shower : Bathing your puppy consistently with a rich oats cleanser will keep his jacket sound, without leaving his skin dry. A solid coat is more averse to have a great deal of free hair to shed. 3. Encourage him a great eating routine : An eating routine that is rich in unsaturated fats, minerals like Zinc and absorbable proteins will keep your puppy's jacket solid and sound, and will help diminish over the top shedding.

      "Dear amit kumar, Thanks for taking time in providing the feedback. To make the products available to all our customers we keep the prices very affordable.  Our packaging designs are of high quality to ensure there is no wear and tear, regret you experienced an issue as such.  We are worried about your pets wellbeing, one tip I would recommend is given him a chance to eat grass, Grass is one of those instinctual cures dogs may go for when they're feeling unwell. Furthermore, do please take him to the vet and please be assured its not as a result of pedigree food, we experience strict enactment while making our items.  No single ingredient/ source of diet will provide all the nutrients and energy requirement of a dog. For eg., Cereals are rich in some vitamins but lack many nutrients required for a dog or puppy. Meat is rich source of proteins but low in Calcium and Vitamin A. Like wise Milk is low in iron and Vitamin D. Dogs can not tolerate too much of milk in their diet. A 7 kg body weight dog can tolerate up to 250 ml of milk and anything excess lead to loose stools. Raw eggs should not be fed to dogs as it can lead to poor skin and hair coat. Nutrients like biotin are not utilized in the body. Raw eggs are also source of infections like salmonella which can cause severe gastroenteritis in dogs.

      "Dear Neelam Bhawsar, Thanks for taking time in providing the feedback. As sustenance is dependably not the purpose for the medical problems particularly hair problems, the reason can be dog's novel hair development cycle and regular hair shedding or pooches additionally may shed over the top hair due to pressure, cruel atmosphere and general sickness or some therapeutic conditions, for example, thyroid illness or skin hypersensitivities can cause exorbitant shedding. A few hints to avoid or decrease hair shedding incorporates:   1. Brush, brush, brush : A day by day brushing works best since it disposes of the majority of your pooch's free hair. On the off chance that you can't brush him consistently, go for no less than two great brushings for every week. 2. Give him a shower : Bathing your puppy consistently with a rich oats cleanser will keep his jacket sound, without leaving his skin dry. A solid coat is more averse to have a great deal of free hair to shed. 3. Encourage him a great eating routine : An eating routine that is rich in unsaturated fats, minerals like Zinc and absorbable proteins will keep your puppy's jacket solid and sound, and will help diminish over the top shedding. Eg., Pedigree \"dynamic\" for grown up canines  If you're worried your dog might have a food allergy, take them to see your vet. Your vet will be able to help diagnose any problems.

      "Dear Jay, Your input will help us, thanks for writing. Rest assured, the products sold on Amazon are original predigree products.  I would suggest you to select which type of food will suit your dog. Here are few guidelines:  Your dog's calorie and nutrient requirements are based on his body weight, his age, his physiological state (growing, pregnant or lactating?) and his activity level. First select the right type of food for his lifestyle, then weigh your dog (don't guess) and feed according to the feeding guide provided with the food. It is, however, important to remember that all dogs are individuals and feeding guides are recommendations only. So, most importantly, monitor your dog's body condition and weight regularly, adjusting the amount you are feeding to ensure that body weight and condition are optimum so that he is neither losing nor gaining weight.  Please share your contact number so we can assist you better. Regards, Team Pedigree\n",

The ingredients we utilize are a watchful mix to ensure they get along right.  Food allergies in pets are relatively rare and are estimated to account for less than 10% of all allergies. However, in the same way that some people cannot tolerate certain dietary components such as wheat gluten or cows milk protein, a small number of pets have allergies or dietary sensitivity to foods such as beef, wheat or dairy.
