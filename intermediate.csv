The delivery was quick in 2 days. So no complaints with Amazon.Now to review this product..To my bewildered amazement, the cat won't even touch it. I tried to mix it with his regular food to give him a taste of it but no success. Now if you search for a review of this product elsewhere you'd find many not recommending it because it has meat in very less quantity. Not good for carnivorous animals. So i wouldn't recommend this product, nor keep feeding this to your beloved pets to the existing buyers. But reading all the positive reviews here on Amazon, it also might be the Tuna flavour my cat is being fussy about. Therefore won't recommend to buy this particular product.","amzn1.account.AFAZPLTCTCZOKUPOBIJBA7EL7GOA","Abhishek Savant","Amazon India","R25A7JNVRJ90Y5","1.0 out of 5 stars","Our customers are our first priority.

So I started adding 1/4th tsp of Psyllium Husk and additional water to it, and that solved it. But then, it requires some effort. If she had just a bite or little bit from it, then either throw the remaining, I mean you can't keep it for ever, or refrigerate it, that also may not be feasible for long. So I ended up wasting quite a bit.With this it's easy, just fill a bowl with this and keep another bowl with water next to it. If she has a little bit, the remainder can still remain in the bowl as it doesn't get spoilt.Overall it costs about Rs.5-6- more than the chicken/fish combo I was giving, but then considering the diet of a cat, it doesn't come to anything substantive.","amzn1.account.AFMILO7LJIIUB3SMXQELZ7ALW2YA","Emron","Amazon India","R24VVB9GBEZ0E0","5.0 out of 5 stars","We are happy that the product met your expectations!

Or it's possible that Whiskas just packages the same thing into different bags and calls them fancy names, but they're all made from horse leather rejects..but who knows, or cares, as long as the cats like it, right?I've been feeding this to my cats for over 3 years now without any issues.One thing though - this feed is available in 3kg and 7kg variants, and the sellers for these keep trying to jiggle the prices around and game the system.

The salmon parcels are OK, but don't have that real salmon flavour that I had hoped for.The snacks are quite bland in flavour, so I add salt and pepper, or a little chilli, as I prefer a little zing on my snacks.It comes in a brightly-coloured packet with a picture of a little cat on it - my girlfriend thinks it's really cute!All in all, I would recommend this as a pleasant change from peanuts, mixture or crisps, with your G&T; or a glass of beer.","amzn1.account.AHNQOEGE6ZB5DB2BZKMI3GXO2YEA","Johnnie Sinclair","Amazon India","R24P5AG3FRKR20","5.0 out of 5 stars","We are happy that the product met your expectations!

"568","34.8914285714","106560","positive","97.4","Technically, my cats should be reviewing this on the taste parameter, but if I speak for them, they seem to enjoy this cat food a lot. They have a thick, shiny coat and have been keeping good health. It gives a wholesome nutrition and they don't seem to want any other food once they are full. However, like humans even cats tend to get bored, so please offer them some wet food and fish treats from time to time. However this dry food is perfect as a regular meal. Be sure to sprinkle the food with water sometimes to make it moist. Cats are known to consume very less water- which is detrimental to their health (especially liver) and hygiene and also makes their urine more pungent smelling. So ensure that they drink enough water especially in the summer, and one of the best way to do that is to sprinkle some water into this wet food every time they eat, and let it sit for a while till the kibble absorbs the water and becomes soft and moist.Pros of ordering it on Amazon:1. The 7 kg packet is very heavy and mostly unavailable elsewhere, so it's really convenient when Amazon delivers it at your doorstep.2. The packaging is great, and delivery is super fast, e.g. within 1-3 days of ordering.3. Keep a lookout for discounts and offers.

"721","13.4238461538","106713","positive","98.7","When my cat was a kitten, she was one of a litter of four that belonged to a toothless hag in the village.  I'm not sure if she was a witch or not, but she treated the kittens very badly and fed them on rice and milk.I kidnapped one kitten, and she was in poor health so I took her directly to the Vet.  The vet carried out all necessary treatments for parasites, and then advised me to change the diet immediately.  He recommended the Whiskas Kitten Food, and I changed this to the adult variety as soon as my kitten morphed into a cat.The Vet told me that this Whiskas food is a balanced diet for the cat.  It contains all the required vitamins and minerals a cat requires for a long, healthy life, strong bones and a loud meow.The Whiskas cat food is small biscuits painstakingly sculpted into the shape of fish.  I don't live near the coast, so my cat doesn't even know what a fish looks like, but she loves this food and is very healthy.Because this is a dry food it is MOST IMPORTANT that your cat has free access to drinking water at all times.  This is also stated on the packet.Having this delivered by Amazon saved me the trouble of lugging a 7kg sack of cat food all the way from the shops to my home.  I am happy with the product and the service, and my cat is over the moon.","amzn1.account.AHNQOEGE6ZB5DB2BZKMI3GXO2YEA","Johnnie Sinclair","Amazon India","R1S7DBISS4R8IJ","5.0 out of 5 stars","Glad that your pet liked it customer name.

Thank you Amazon and the vendor.Edit: November 2015I have decided to re-write my review about this product. I have not changed my initial review to show you how things changed over time. My cats love this product and I was really happy when I saw them eat this. It came to a level where my cats chose not to eat anything other than this and a similar product from another brand. One of my cat unfortunately has been diagnosed with a partial renal failure. His creatine values are very high and I sought opinions from 2-3 different vets. All of them blamed high proteins for these values due the prolonged use of this product. He is on a month long treatment of saline and renal food. Everything else has been stopped and my cat will now be on a permanent diet of renal food. Please don't take this easy way of feeding your cats if you really love and care about them. Consult your vet before using this product. I'm repenting for not doing that. I'm not saying it is bad, but at least the vet will guide you on the quantity and frequency of feeding this to your cats. I have now got changes in the diets of my younger cats!","amzn1.account.AH3MBAK3SRQ4U2IGFFC5PN3TXAQQ","Deal Stalker","Amazon India","R1WPVWR7IF5GCU","1.0 out of 5 stars","Our customers are our first priority.

He told me that such a great discount is offered only when the product is nearing its expiry which kind of worried me. Even I wondered, for a such a big discount, there has to be something wrong. Well, I just crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.Finally, the product arrived today. I ripped it open and first saw the mfg. date and it was July 2014! I was elated and immediately turned on my laptop to write about this. Thank you Amazon for the truly excellent packaging, service and delivery.Looking forward for such excellent deals.

She was happy with roti dal rice etc. Then i decided to treat her and bought pedigree. She puked on the first day of eating pedigree,..i didnt realise it was due to the pedigree that she was puking. For a two days she got weaker and stopped eating. Two days later i put her on curd rice which she started to eat. But in my excitement i again fed her pedigree.. the following day she puked and had thin stinky stool and developed partial parallysis. From there it was all down hill despite my prayers.. poor Nanhi died two days later after having struggled with a convulsing stomach all night, trying to puke even when there was nothing left.. iit has taken me two months to overcome the shock and write this review. This was because an emaciated kitten i was nursing fm a week ago also died after i fed him pedigree. It seems that this pedigree is a poison for young animals.

It may have to do with the pellet size, which is bigger than Pedigree puppy, Pedigree Senior and Chappi. One can purchase a small pack before buying the bulk ones. Also, since it is one of the reasonably priced kibbles, there is compromise on the nutritional value. Contains more of fillers and less of meat (once again, those with higher meat content are costlier). Try not to feed it to your pet. They will do much better on home cooked food.

Seems like the feedback here really made them look into and fix the issues other reviewers and customers were having.Smells a little nauseating, but hey, it's dog food, what'd I expect?Store in an airtight container once opened, also, follow the serving instructions depending on your dog's age and breed. Overfeeding will result in a lot of health complications, so be careful there.

"1924","7.73090909091","107927","positive","96.75","Hi,I have been using this Pedigree product for over two years now and regretting my lack of market research. This is the worst pet food you can give to any animal.Pedigree Dog Food and Pedigree Cat Food are exactly the same. It contains only Corn and Chemical Artificial Flavours. Neither the dog food nor the cat food of Pedigree contains any meat. It has no chicken, no meat, no ocean fish, no milk. All the products of Pedigree contain ONLY Corn and chemical flavours that fool your pet into eating it.Of course, if you do a simple little bit of study you will find that home made food is best for your dogs and cats and other pets. In case you have no choice, I would suggest Drools FOCUS Puppy Food which has real chicken and is lot more expensive than this corn food. Another option is Royal Canin but it has to be imported so it is even more expensive than Drools.Pedigree is widely advertised with family friendly and cute kids and furry animals on TV and other media. So people think this company cares about pets. They don't. They feed your pets corn and some by products like chicken feet, beak, animal hooves, and other remains which even a stray dog / cat would want to avoid.Think about it. If you buy One Kilo Chicken from your local slaughterhouse even in expensive Mumbai costs maximum Rs. 110. That is 100% chichen weighing One Kilo. Isn't that better than spending Rs. 1000 on corn flavoured to smell like chicken? If you love your pet, try the home made one. If you want emergency stock of pet food when you don't have time for preparing it at home, go for Drools Focus or Royal Canin.","amzn1.account.AFVFGVFOC6WUUL7VZ3ZSBDAFMPOA","Ujjwal Dey","Amazon India","R2LCHMYRJ6TLJR","1","We are happy that the product met your expectations!

I advise trying to feed your dog only (in descending order) chicken,eggs and vegetables all boiled for a couple of weeks, preferably a month and compare his coat,joins,bowel movement after the time period is over and see the difference yourself.I can't believe this thing have 4.5 ratings from 350+ people","amzn1.account.AFK5OOSF6O7X6K22QTNQWEPQAPAQ","Riddhesh","Amazon India","R2T1NSMV43XJFO","1","Our customers are our first priority.

Sure there are more refined/costlier foods available, but overall, and for daily usage, Pedigree is the most convenient option as per my choice.I tried Meat and Rice but my dog got fed up in a few days so coming back to this again. Also, meat and rice makes my dog's poop green which shouldnt normally be the case. This one bought his stool color back to normal in 3 days.I feed him pedigree in afternoon and night, boiled chicken and Rice in morning. And this seems to be a very good choice.

I have tried pedigree earlier also, but always got bad results. This is my last time, in future I will never give it my dog.According to my experience I must say that royal canin and drools focus are best. Even simple drools puppy food is also good. Bust royal canin is best of all. Royal canin is costly, but it is worth the price. It will improve the overall health, looks of your dog. Pedigree is just waste of money.

"3172","67.9025","109195","positive","98.7","The truth is I have not even once bought this from Amazon.in but use to buy it from a local vendor here in Meghalaya. I have witnessed a few months back where I use to feed my cats products other than whiskas and I see their development is very slow, but after feeding whiskas for 2 - 3 weeks I notice a lot of change in them, they are more active, happy and playful, their hair quality also changed dramatically from a dull appearance to a shiny, long and healthy one. Whiskas does a lot of good to my cats.I currently have 13 cats of different breed, the method I use when feeding them is that I use to take a cup full of whiskas in a bowl and pour one cup of boiling water over it and cover it leaving it till the boiling water is fully absorbed, them I mixed the now softened whiskas with one plate of rice. I feed them this  way twice a day also I have a separate bowl for giving them water so that they will not drink water from drains when they're thirsty.If you're planning to buy, go for it, I'm sure you'll beginning to see a lot of positive change in your cats.

The smell of this is less pungent than Meo. Whiskas seems to be more easily available online at all times. The lowest price that I have bought it at is Rs. 292. Very reasonably priced. To make it more exciting for kitty I add some liquid of the Whiskas Tuna in jelly wet meal to the dry food and Kitty loves to eat the soaked granules.

Cant exactly say she loves it, but am sure she doesnt complain. Being dry food, it is always better to complement it with wet food once or twice weekly. Providing fresh water is really important. Between this and other brand that my friend uses for his kitten, I have noticed a much better coat in mine. It can be genetic or from the food, cant really say. Also leaving it in the tray is a problem as it absorbs moisture readily and my kitten doesn't like it once it has taken moisture in. I would suggest you try plain dry food first and sprinkle water only if your kitten absolutely doesn't like the kibble as is. Overall a great product and value for money. As far as amazon is concerned, I got it during the Great Indian festival sale at a very good price. The package it came in was really neatly and securely packed.","amzn1.account.AE7FQMWAYBRDZ7CLSXQZPHFERIUA","Amazon Customer","Amazon India","RF5XVZDJ9TFQ7","5.0 out of 5 stars","Our customers are our first priority.

None were ready to eat.What I noticed:1. Instead of Jelly, there was liquid in the can.  (Lets assume that, the jelly melted off due to Summer heat).2. That jelly didn't freeze back even after 2 days of refrigeration. Typically, the cans I purchase in a store near by, the jelly solidifies once i put it in AC room.3. The Tuna pieces were different - This was very much noticeable to my eyes.All my observations + the feedback from my cats = DONT BUY. I will not say this is a fake or whatever because, I don't know! My cats are not eating and your cats may not eat too because 'Cats know the difference'.============= Edit on 9th May 2017.Having said above, I wanted to add some more to this review.I got Same cans from my local store.  My cats ate a part of the can and i saved the rest for next session.  By then, all the jelly became liquid and then when i served it to my cats, they refused to eat.So, I learnt that, once the jelly in the can melts off, cats wont like the stuff.Unfortunately, in all the cans that I got from Amazon, the jelly is already in liquid state and I believe, that should be the reason they are not eating it.","amzn1.account.AGOEGESJ7IWYTUXYGMRROVKJDIWA","Ram Babu Gorre","Amazon India","R1VVDEVFQHY1OO","1.0 out of 5 stars","DearRam Babu Gorre, We are sorry for the inconvenience caused.Please get in touch with us on our toll free number 1800 4071 12121 or write to us at pedigree.india@effem.com.

Puppy's love the smell of it and they will start jumping and wagging their tail.I have a German shepherd puppy and this is one of her favourite food.I mix it with pedigree dry food or white rice and she will eat more food when compare to her usual intake.I usually heat this up for 1 minute in microwave just to bring out some flavour which I prefer personally. The gravy can be given directly out of the pack without cooking/heating as well.Overall the Pedigree combo saves you money and the pedigree gravy can be a treat for your dog like a weekend meal/on a day when she does something really nice.","amzn1.account.AFY6EBKOQKSUPNH22JSWOSZ2N4GA","kannan","Amazon India","R1E06ORMNLQFFX","5","We are happy that the product met your expectations!

You can mix it with rice, can also give it with the dry food (adjust the portion size accordingly), chapatis, bread,eggs etc.The box contain 15 packets which don't require refrigeration if unopened.And lastly if you have a senior dog like mine, introduce the food in small portions.Thanks for reading the review.","amzn1.account.AEUS7YSMKZQA6V6NWPOND6M7WUAA","mansi mudgal","Amazon India","R14WY1DBDLPYOH","5.0 out of 5 stars","We are happy that the product met your expectations!

She did not like the prawns (there were many of these pieces in the first tin) and kept them for eating last. Everything around them she ate and relished. Eventually, after it just sat in her bowl for hours she ate it when she was really hungry. In the second tin, the dark brown pieces, which I assume are the prawns  (as seen in the shared picture),  were significantly less and so she ate it up in one go! Why the manufacturer cannot maintain consistency in all the tins?This wet meal is really expensive feed on a daily basis. I got it at a deal price of Rs.210. Arrived in time and well packed. Only there was a mix up, again! The chicken one was sent instead of the tuna & prawns, which got a replaced later. Negligence? deliberate? I don't know but I infer from other reviews that this mix up is routine and happens often! it happened to me twice.

I obviously had to throw the whole 15kg pack and a waste of my money but above all my pet was eating that infected Pedigree before I noticed the worms.I dont know if its the seller or the amazon warehouse where this got messed up but I swear to never call for any edible products from Amazon and I am highly disappointed and disgusted by their lack of responsibility.","amzn1.account.AE5JJ2JKL4VIGFGREU5FOPLILEZQ","meher","Amazon India","R1PU41F3YGFDHV","1","Dearmeher, We are sorry for the inconvenience caused.Please get in touch with us on our toll free number 1800 4071 12121 or write to us at pedigree.india@effem.com.

Yes, it is also a bit pricier than other options but it's also more worth it. I like that the kitten food also has milk pockets so there is a variation in taste. No other brand has this. My kittens seem to be addicted to it lol, it's gobbled up in seconds. I just hope they start making one in a larger volume pack.
