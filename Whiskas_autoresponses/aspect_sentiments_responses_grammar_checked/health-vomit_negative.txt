Bring a sample of the vomit to the veterinarian. The veterinarian will then take the cat's temperature and examine its abdomen. If it turns out to be no more than a passing incident, the veterinarian may ask you to limit the cat's diet to clear fluids and to collect stool samples over that period, as the underlying cause may be passed along in the stool.
