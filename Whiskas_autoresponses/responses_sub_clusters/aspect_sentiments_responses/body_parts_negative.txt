hairs and fur or skin:- 
 As food is always not the reason behind the health issues especially hair loss, the culprit can be dog's unique hair growth cycle and seasonal hair shedding or dogs also may shed excessive hair because of stress, harsh climate and general illness or some medical conditions such as thyroid disease or skin allergies can cause excessive shedding. Some tips to prevent or reduce hair shedding includes: -

 2. Give him a bath : Bathing your dog regularly with a rich oatmeal shampoo will help to keep his coat healthy, without leaving his skin dry. A healthy coat is less likely to have a lot of loose hair to shed.

skin:- 
   Food is not always the reason behind skin problems of your pet. If you feed food like raw eggs repeatedly, can cause skin problem.But if that's not the issue we are always here to serve you.
   
General:- 
  No single ingredient/ source of diet will provide all the nutrients and energy requirement of a dog. For eg., Cereals are rich in some vitamins but lack many nutrients required for a dog or puppy. Meat is rich source of proteins but low in Calcium and Vitamin A. Like wise Milk is low in iron and Vitamin D. Dogs can not tolerate too much of milk in their diet. A 7 kg body weight dog can tolerate up to 250 ml of milk and anything excess lead to loose stools. Raw eggs should not be fed to dogs as it can lead to poor skin and hair coat. Nutrients like biotin are not utilized in the body. Raw eggs are also source of infections like salmonella which can cause severe gastroenteritis in dogs.
  
  I would suggest you to select which type of food will suit your dog. Here are few guidelines:-
  Your dog's calorie and nutrient requirements are based on his body weight, his age, his physiological state (growing, pregnant or lactating?) and his activity level. First select the right type of food for his lifestyle, then weigh your dog (don't guess) and feed according to the feeding guide provided with the food. It is, however, important to remember that all dogs are individuals and feeding guides are recommendations only. So, most importantly, monitor your dog's body condition and weight regularly, adjusting the amount you are feeding to ensure that body weight and condition are optimum so that he is neither losing nor gaining weight.
