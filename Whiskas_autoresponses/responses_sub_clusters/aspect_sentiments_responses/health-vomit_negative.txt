An occasional, isolated bout of vomiting is normal. However, frequent vomiting can be a sign of a more serious condition. Please bring your cat to the vet for a complete examination and diagnosis.
In certain situations your cat may require fluid therapy or antiemetics-drugs to help control vomiting. You'll need to see your vet to determine the proper remedy.
Bring a sample of the vomit to the veterinarian. The veterinarian will then take the cat's temperature and examine its abdomen. If it turns out to be no more than a passing incident, the veterinarian may ask you to limit the cat's diet to clear fluids and to collect stool samples over that period, as the underlying cause may be passed along in the stool.
