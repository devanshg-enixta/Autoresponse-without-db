You can mix it with rice, can also give it with the dry food (adjust the portion size accordingly), chapatis, bread,eggs etc.The box contain 15 packets which don't require refrigeration if unopened.And lastly if you have a senior dog like mine, introduce the food in small portions.Thanks for reading the review."~"amzn1.account.AEUS7YSMKZQA6V6NWPOND6M7WUAA"~"mansi mudgal"~"Amazon India"~"R14WY1DBDLPYOH"~"5.0 out of 5 stars"~"Glad that your pet liked it mansi mudgal.

They have a thick, shiny coat and have been keeping good health. It gives a wholesome nutrition and they don't seem to want any other food once they are full. However, like humans even cats tend to get bored, so please offer them some wet food and fish treats from time to time. However this dry food is perfect as a regular meal. Be sure to sprinkle the food with water sometimes to make it moist. Cats are known to consume very less water- which is detrimental to their health (especially liver) and hygiene and also makes their urine more pungent smelling. So ensure that they drink enough water especially in the summer, and one of the best way to do that is to sprinkle some water into this wet food every time they eat, and let it sit for a while till the kibble absorbs the water and becomes soft and moist.Pros of ordering it on Amazon:1. The 7 kg packet is very heavy and mostly unavailable elsewhere, so it's really convenient when Amazon delivers it at your doorstep.2. The packaging is great, and delivery is super fast, e.g. within 1-3 days of ordering.3. Keep a lookout for discounts and offers.

I'm not sure if she was a witch or not, but she treated the kittens very badly and fed them on rice and milk.I kidnapped one kitten, and she was in poor health so I took her directly to the Vet.  The vet carried out all necessary treatments for parasites, and then advised me to change the diet immediately.  He recommended the Whiskas Kitten Food, and I changed this to the adult variety as soon as my kitten morphed into a cat.The Vet told me that this Whiskas food is a balanced diet for the cat.  It contains all the required vitamins and minerals a cat requires for a long, healthy life, strong bones and a loud meow.The Whiskas cat food is small biscuits painstakingly sculpted into the shape of fish.  I don't live near the coast, so my cat doesn't even know what a fish looks like, but she loves this food and is very healthy.Because this is a dry food it is MOST IMPORTANT that your cat has free access to drinking water at all times.  This is also stated on the packet.Having this delivered by Amazon saved me the trouble of lugging a 7kg sack of cat food all the way from the shops to my home.

I have witnessed a few months back where I use to feed my cats products other than whiskas and I see their development is very slow, but after feeding whiskas for 2 - 3 weeks I notice a lot of change in them, they are more active, happy and playful, their hair quality also changed dramatically from a dull appearance to a shiny, long and healthy one. Whiskas does a lot of good to my cats.I currently have 13 cats of different breed, the method I use when feeding them is that I use to take a cup full of whiskas in a bowl and pour one cup of boiling water over it and cover it leaving it till the boiling water is fully absorbed, them I mixed the now softened whiskas with one plate of rice. I feed them this  way twice a day also I have a separate bowl for giving them water so that they will not drink water from drains when they're thirsty.If you're planning to buy, go for it, I'm sure you'll beginning to see a lot of positive change in your cats.

None were ready to eat.What I noticed:1. Instead of Jelly, there was liquid in the can.  (Lets assume that, the jelly melted off due to Summer heat).2. That jelly didn't freeze back even after 2 days of refrigeration. Typically, the cans I purchase in a store near by, the jelly solidifies once i put it in AC room.3. The Tuna pieces were different - This was very much noticeable to my eyes.All my observations + the feedback from my cats = DONT BUY. I will not say this is a fake or whatever because, I don't know! My cats are not eating and your cats may not eat too because 'Cats know the difference'.============= Edit on 9th May 2017.Having said above, I wanted to add some more to this review.I got Same cans from my local store.  My cats ate a part of the can and i saved the rest for next session.  By then, all the jelly became liquid and then when i served it to my cats, they refused to eat.So, I learnt that, once the jelly in the can melts off, cats wont like the stuff.Unfortunately, in all the cans that I got from Amazon, the jelly is already in liquid state and I believe, that should be the reason they are not eating it."~"amzn1.account.AGOEGESJ7IWYTUXYGMRROVKJDIWA"~"Ram Babu Gorre"~"Amazon India"~"R1VVDEVFQHY1OO"~"1.0 out of 5 stars"~"Dear Ram Babu Gorre, We apologize for the bother caused.

My cats also loved the box that this bag came in, so a better than imagined deal for me! Thank you Amazon and the vendor.Edit: November 2015I have decided to re-write my review about this product. I have not changed my initial review to show you how things changed over time. My cats love this product and I was really happy when I saw them eat this. It came to a level where my cats chose not to eat anything other than this and a similar product from another brand. One of my cat unfortunately has been diagnosed with a partial renal failure. His creatine values are very high and I sought opinions from 2-3 different vets. All of them blamed high proteins for these values due the prolonged use of this product. He is on a month long treatment of saline and renal food. Everything else has been stopped and my cat will now be on a permanent diet of renal food. Please don't take this easy way of feeding your cats if you really love and care about them. Consult your vet before using this product. I'm repenting for not doing that. I'm not saying it is bad, but at least the vet will guide you on the quantity and frequency of feeding this to your cats.

"[nutrition_ingredientst, pricing]"~"[chicken, combo]"~"18.393"~"0"~"106279"~"positive"~"96.0"~"Easiest way to give your cat complete nutrition.Earlier I was giving my 6 months old kitty, a mixture of boiled minced chicken and fish, but she started getting frequent constipation. So I started adding 1/4th tsp of Psyllium Husk and additional water to it, and that solved it. But then, it requires some effort. If she had just a bite or little bit from it, then either throw the remaining, I mean you can't keep it for ever, or refrigerate it, that also may not be feasible for long. So I ended up wasting quite a bit.With this it's easy, just fill a bowl with this and keep another bowl with water next to it. If she has a little bit, the remainder can still remain in the bowl as it doesn't get spoilt.Overall it costs about Rs.5-6- more than the chicken/fish combo I was giving, but then considering the diet of a cat, it doesn't come to anything substantive."~"amzn1.account.AFMILO7LJIIUB3SMXQELZ7ALW2YA"~"Emron"~"Amazon India"~"R24VVB9GBEZ0E0"~"5.0 out of 5 stars"~"Glad that your pet liked it Emron.

Bought it in a deal at Rs 210. Was surprised to note that the tin itself is really small (the size of a medium tomato!) and all of its contents of 85 gms was gone within minutes! It is expensive to give on a daily basis but the quality seems really good. I had ordered the tuna one and this was shipped to me instead. Though this mistake worked out well for me this time, it happened for two orders and I requested to replace one. I wonder why adequate care is not taken and the correct item ordered is shipped to the customer? Careless attitude. I read in other reviews too that they faced similar mix ups. Since I'm rating only the product its 5 stars if it was product plus service its goes down to 2.5!

A few days after my order was confirmed, I just shared this with my colleagues and asked one of them to buy food for his dogs from Amazon itself, especially during these lighting deals. He told me that such a great discount is offered only when the product is nearing its expiry which kind of worried me. Even I wondered, for a such a big discount, there has to be something wrong. Well, I just crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.Finally, the product arrived today. I ripped it open and first saw the mfg. date and it was July 2014! I was elated and immediately turned on my laptop to write about this. Thank you Amazon for the truly excellent packaging, service and delivery.Looking forward for such excellent deals.

This is the worst pet food you can give to any animal.Pedigree Dog Food and Pedigree Cat Food are exactly the same. It contains only Corn and Chemical Artificial Flavours. Neither the dog food nor the cat food of Pedigree contains any meat. It has no chicken, no meat, no ocean fish, no milk. All the products of Pedigree contain ONLY Corn and chemical flavours that fool your pet into eating it.Of course, if you do a simple little bit of study you will find that home made food is best for your dogs and cats and other pets. In case you have no choice, I would suggest Drools FOCUS Puppy Food which has real chicken and is lot more expensive than this corn food. Another option is Royal Canin but it has to be imported so it is even more expensive than Drools.Pedigree is widely advertised with family friendly and cute kids and furry animals on TV and other media. So people think this company cares about pets. They don't. They feed your pets corn and some by products like chicken feet, beak, animal hooves, and other remains which even a stray dog / cat would want to avoid.Think about it. If you buy One Kilo Chicken from your local slaughterhouse even in expensive Mumbai costs maximum Rs. 110. That is 100% chichen weighing One Kilo. Isn't that better than spending Rs. 1000 on corn flavoured to smell like chicken? If you love your pet, try the home made one. If you want emergency stock of pet food when you don't have time for preparing it at home, go for Drools Focus or Royal Canin."~"amzn1.account.AFVFGVFOC6WUUL7VZ3ZSBDAFMPOA"~"Ujjwal Dey"~"Amazon India"~"R2LCHMYRJ6TLJR"~"1.0"~"Dear Ujjwal Dey, Our customers are our first priority.

Well look no further.Ref:http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/pedigree.htmlRef: http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/pedigree-dog-food-dry/Well, I hope atleast 2-3 people read this and do themselves a favor.Pedigree, aka. the food which shows 6 signs of 'good' health more like 6 signs of tricking people into buying the productI have fed my puppy Pedigree for sometime, he was alright on it...just like a kid would be alright on cornflakes all day-night for a month or a year atmost..untill they start showing innumerable signs of bad health.They advertise the food containing Chicken and Veg...well that means there's gotta be loads of chicken and little bit of veggies too, right?Well let's take a look at the ingredients (reference given above) Ground whole grain corn, poultry by-product meal (source of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate), corn gluten meal, animal fat (source of omega 6 fatty acids [preserved with BHA & citric acid]), meat and bone meal (source of calcium), soybean meal, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, brewers rice, dried plain beet pulp, natural flavor, salt, calcium carbonate, potassium chloride, monocalcium phosphate, dried peas, vitamins (choline chloride, vitamin E supplement, niacin [vitamin B3], biotin, d-calcium pantothenate [source of vitamin B5], riboflavin supplement [vitamin B2], pyridoxine hydrochloride [vitamin B6], vitamin A supplement, vitamin B12 supplement, thiamine mononitrate [vitamin B1], vitamin D3 supplement), minerals (zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide), dried carrots, added color (red 40, yellow 5, blue 2), BHA & citric acid (a preservative)Where is chicken I'd ask, you'd probably say in the second ingredient poultry by-product meal... well that's nothing but literally the by-products of poultry i.e. anything except the meat..eg.Chicken feet, undeveloped eggs, chicken heads, their body parts(all of them)Keep in mind that they are written in a descending order (higher to lower), highest in corn..which is not even a vegetable but a grain...full of calories, part reason why most of large sized dogs (labs mostly) in India are obese.If you tell that your dog is just fine and eats the food crazily..well this review probably won't make sense to you but just imagine a kid eating kellogs/cornflakes like his staple meal. I advise trying to feed your dog only (in descending order) chicken,eggs and vegetables all boiled for a couple of weeks, preferably a month and compare his coat,joins,bowel movement after the time period is over and see the difference yourself.I can't believe this thing have 4.5 ratings from 350+ people"~"amzn1.account.AFK5OOSF6O7X6K22QTNQWEPQAPAQ"~"Riddhesh"~"Amazon India"~"R2T1NSMV43XJFO"~"1.0"~"Glad that your pet liked it Riddhesh.

Now at 8 months, that seems to have changed a bit and she purrs only when I am giving her Meo Ocean Fish. She does not seem overly excited about this meal but eats up nevertheless. The smell of this is less pungent than Meo. Whiskas seems to be more easily available online at all times. The lowest price that I have bought it at is Rs. 292. Very reasonably priced. To make it more exciting for kitty I add some liquid of the Whiskas Tuna in jelly wet meal to the dry food and Kitty loves to eat the soaked granules. The 1.1 Kg pack lasts for approximately 2 weeks in addition to two wet meals per week. My Kitten likes this, the vet approves it and it is pocket friendly; so its a thumbs up from me."~"amzn1.account.AHFEMTCLKXQDWQ256UMFIQ6LTFDA"~"Kiran"~"Amazon India"~"R31FJIXVN7YZ48"~"5.0 out of 5 stars"~"Glad that your pet liked it Kiran.

The reason for all these is the courier company the shipper/seller uses. The DELIVERY LOCATION of this item is EXACTLY 110 kms from sellers warehouse but the courier company shipped the item to Hyderabad which is 600Kms away and next travelled back to Anantapur and finally to my home town which took over 8 days. This made the ants and other insects to live in!Suggestion: I suggest the seller to ship items by to metro and other cities by FedEx and other through EMS Speedpost/DTDC/Professional courier etc"~"amzn1.account.AGO63G4VCPNKGTFHOGOU2JOFCCWA"~"Kitchu"~"Amazon India"~"R3D5XHBITE7ZHR"~"4.0 out of 5 stars"~"Glad that your pet liked it Kitchu.

Still in this fast life people generally don't have enough time. I myself give Pedigree to my lab. As far as Dog food is concern I've tried Royal canin (very expensive, so I ditched it) , Drool (the worst Dog food, buy only for your enemy's dog) and Pedigree. Overall Pedigree is fair and good among all the said brands, it's economical (not much, but we don't have options).As far as my lab's health is concern I found he's quite healthy, happy, shining coat after I started this.Still I don't feed him much market food and try to feed him on homemade food, if I want to give him something which is not homemade Pedigree is the one.

She had a paw missig and i adopted her fm the street. She was happy with roti dal rice etc. Then i decided to treat her and bought pedigree. She puked on the first day of eating pedigree,..i didnt realise it was due to the pedigree that she was puking. For a two days she got weaker and stopped eating. Two days later i put her on curd rice which she started to eat. But in my excitement i again fed her pedigree.. the following day she puked and had thin stinky stool and developed partial parallysis. From there it was all down hill despite my prayers.. poor Nanhi died two days later after having struggled with a convulsing stomach all night, trying to puke even when there was nothing left.. iit has taken me two months to overcome the shock and write this review. This was because an emaciated kitten i was nursing fm a week ago also died after i fed him pedigree. It seems that this pedigree is a poison for young animals.

She seems to love it.It was manufactured on 25/08/2016 and sold by Cloudtail, so pretty fresh. Seems like the feedback here really made them look into and fix the issues other reviewers and customers were having.Smells a little nauseating, but hey, it's dog food, what'd I expect?Store in an airtight container once opened, also, follow the serving instructions depending on your dog's age and breed. Overfeeding will result in a lot of health complications, so be careful there. The instructions are included on the packing or on the Pedigree website.Would recommend, although my review here doesn't really help you make a decision due to my niche application."~"amzn1.account.AFFOQ55VIHIROP3C3IMR4XRUCW3A"~"Sen"~"Amazon India"~"RAX73R78071J5"~"4.0"~"Glad that your pet liked it Sen.

Cant exactly say she loves it, but am sure she doesnt complain. Being dry food, it is always better to complement it with wet food once or twice weekly. Providing fresh water is really important. Between this and other brand that my friend uses for his kitten, I have noticed a much better coat in mine. It can be genetic or from the food, cant really say. Also leaving it in the tray is a problem as it absorbs moisture readily and my kitten doesn't like it once it has taken moisture in. I would suggest you try plain dry food first and sprinkle water only if your kitten absolutely doesn't like the kibble as is. Overall a great product and value for money. As far as amazon is concerned, I got it during the Great Indian festival sale at a very good price. The package it came in was really neatly and securely packed."~"amzn1.account.AE7FQMWAYBRDZ7CLSXQZPHFERIUA"~"Amazon Customer"~"Amazon India"~"RF5XVZDJ9TFQ7"~"5.0 out of 5 stars"~"Glad that your pet liked it Amazon Customer.

I'm really pleased to have found something tempting enough for her to devour immediately that we can reward her with.This is the first raw hide type treat we have given her that she hasn't just sat on for a few days...it took her a good 10-15 minutes to get through so good for her teeth and it was nice to see her enjoying something for more than a split second...Having said that I would still recommend these treats, I think they are a little on the expensive side but they are made from almost all nice and natural ingredients and make an ideal occasional treat/reward."~"amzn1.account.AEQRYFSSX35ZFP64C2CHBDYS7WMA"~"SwordFish"~"Amazon India"~"RVKZZTQUZET5E"~"5.0"~"Glad that your pet liked it SwordFish.

In the second tin, the dark brown pieces, which I assume are the prawns  (as seen in the shared picture),  were significantly less and so she ate it up in one go! Why the manufacturer cannot maintain consistency in all the tins?This wet meal is really expensive feed on a daily basis. I got it at a deal price of Rs.210. Arrived in time and well packed. Only there was a mix up, again! The chicken one was sent instead of the tuna & prawns, which got a replaced later. Negligence? deliberate?

Whiskas so far wins hands down. The best part is it has no odor, is premium quality and the nutritional effects are visible in the way of a shinier softer coat. Yes, it is also a bit pricier than other options but it's also more worth it. I like that the kitten food also has milk pockets so there is a variation in taste. No other brand has this. My kittens seem to be addicted to it lol, it's gobbled up in seconds. I just hope they start making one in a larger volume pack.

The reason we delayed the results was to thoroughly check for any anomalies that might have cropped up during the contest. The 4 winners had got a substantially lesser number of likes till 21st July. The results are on the basis of number of likes they got till 21st July. Rest assured, Pedigree has done a meticulous check of all the participants and their profiles basis the terms and conditions mentioned earlier. We hope you get another chance to win in the future contests we hold. Wish you all the best.

Fall in love with a dog, and in many ways you enter a new orbit, a universe that features not just new colors but new rituals, new rules, a new way of experiencing attachments🐶😘
My dog🐶Tobu doesn't worry about the meaning of life. He may worry if he doesn't get his breakfast, but he doesn't sit around worrying about whether he will get fulfilled or liberated or enlightened. As long as he gets some food and a little affection, his life is Fine 🐶."~"1338778672934532"~"Minakshi Anand"~"Facebook"~"1937503816509624_1938471913079481"~""~"We are happy that the product met your expectations!
