So no complaints with Amazon.Now to review this product..To my bewildered amazement, the cat won't even touch it. I tried to mix it with his regular food to give him a taste of it but no success. Now if you search for a review of this product elsewhere you'd find many not recommending it because it has meat in very less quantity. Not good for carnivorous animals. So i wouldn't recommend this product, nor keep feeding this to your beloved pets to the existing buyers.

106279.0,"Easiest way to give your cat complete nutrition.Earlier I was giving my 6 months old kitty, a mixture of boiled minced chicken and fish, but she started getting frequent constipation. So I started adding 1/4th tsp of Psyllium Husk and additional water to it, and that solved it. But then, it requires some effort. If she had just a bite or little bit from it, then either throw the remaining, I mean you can't keep it for ever, or refrigerate it, that also may not be feasible for long. So I ended up wasting quite a bit.With this it's easy, just fill a bowl with this and keep another bowl with water next to it. If she has a little bit, the remainder can still remain in the bowl as it doesn't get spoilt.Overall it costs about Rs.5-6- more than the chicken/fish combo I was giving, but then considering the diet of a cat, it doesn't come to anything substantive.",amzn1.account.AFMILO7LJIIUB3SMXQELZ7ALW2YA,Emron,Amazon India,R24VVB9GBEZ0E0,5.0 out of 5 stars

Or it's possible that Whiskas just packages the same thing into different bags and calls them fancy names, but they're all made from horse leather rejects..but who knows, or cares, as long as the cats like it, right?I've been feeding this to my cats for over 3 years now without any issues.One thing though - this feed is available in 3kg and 7kg variants, and the sellers for these keep trying to jiggle the prices around and game the system.

The salmon parcels are OK, but don't have that real salmon flavour that I had hoped for.The snacks are quite bland in flavour, so I add salt and pepper, or a little chilli, as I prefer a little zing on my snacks.It comes in a brightly-coloured packet with a picture of a little cat on it - my girlfriend thinks it's really cute!All in all, I would recommend this as a pleasant change from peanuts, mixture or crisps, with your G&T; or a glass of beer.",amzn1.account.AHNQOEGE6ZB5DB2BZKMI3GXO2YEA,Johnnie Sinclair,Amazon India,R24P5AG3FRKR20,5.0 out of 5 stars

So much so that I suspect perhaps Whiskas just prints different bags for the same thing? :)In any case, it works for me.

No problems for the cat.One major caution is Whiskas turned away my cat permanently from real fish and real chicken. It does not touch it. Moreover, it even rejected the Whiskas wet Fish flavored meal and we had to throw it away. Strange are the ways of the cat food.Its possible Whiskas is using organoleptics research  and reward center of cats brain and use such ingredients that cat gets permanently addicted to their dry food.",amzn1.account.AFNZYRDXLQGLISAAGKW33VBEYQIA,The Watch,Amazon India,R3L2M9GCLIL8BH,5.0 out of 5 stars

106560.0,"Technically, my cats should be reviewing this on the taste parameter, but if I speak for them, they seem to enjoy this cat food a lot. They have a thick, shiny coat and have been keeping good health. It gives a wholesome nutrition and they don't seem to want any other food once they are full. However, like humans even cats tend to get bored, so please offer them some wet food and fish treats from time to time. However this dry food is perfect as a regular meal. Be sure to sprinkle the food with water sometimes to make it moist. Cats are known to consume very less water- which is detrimental to their health (especially liver) and hygiene and also makes their urine more pungent smelling. So ensure that they drink enough water especially in the summer, and one of the best way to do that is to sprinkle some water into this wet food every time they eat, and let it sit for a while till the kibble absorbs the water and becomes soft and moist.Pros of ordering it on Amazon:1. The 7 kg packet is very heavy and mostly unavailable elsewhere, so it's really convenient when Amazon delivers it at your doorstep.2. The packaging is great, and delivery is super fast, e.g. within 1-3 days of ordering.3. Keep a lookout for discounts and offers.

106713.0,"When my cat was a kitten, she was one of a litter of four that belonged to a toothless hag in the village.  I'm not sure if she was a witch or not, but she treated the kittens very badly and fed them on rice and milk.I kidnapped one kitten, and she was in poor health so I took her directly to the Vet.  The vet carried out all necessary treatments for parasites, and then advised me to change the diet immediately.  He recommended the Whiskas Kitten Food, and I changed this to the adult variety as soon as my kitten morphed into a cat.The Vet told me that this Whiskas food is a balanced diet for the cat.  It contains all the required vitamins and minerals a cat requires for a long, healthy life, strong bones and a loud meow.The Whiskas cat food is small biscuits painstakingly sculpted into the shape of fish.  I don't live near the coast, so my cat doesn't even know what a fish looks like, but she loves this food and is very healthy.Because this is a dry food it is MOST IMPORTANT that your cat has free access to drinking water at all times.  This is also stated on the packet.Having this delivered by Amazon saved me the trouble of lugging a 7kg sack of cat food all the way from the shops to my home.

Thank you Amazon and the vendor.Edit: November 2015I have decided to re-write my review about this product. I have not changed my initial review to show you how things changed over time. My cats love this product and I was really happy when I saw them eat this. It came to a level where my cats chose not to eat anything other than this and a similar product from another brand. One of my cat unfortunately has been diagnosed with a partial renal failure. His creatine values are very high and I sought opinions from 2-3 different vets. All of them blamed high proteins for these values due the prolonged use of this product. He is on a month long treatment of saline and renal food. Everything else has been stopped and my cat will now be on a permanent diet of renal food. Please don't take this easy way of feeding your cats if you really love and care about them. Consult your vet before using this product. I'm repenting for not doing that. I'm not saying it is bad, but at least the vet will guide you on the quantity and frequency of feeding this to your cats.

106751.0,"I was very satisfied after ordering this 7kg pack for the stray cats in my apartment and it was really worth the price. For 985/- it was definitely worth it and there was no looking back. It was a 'Lightning Deal'. A few days after my order was confirmed, I just shared this with my colleagues and asked one of them to buy food for his dogs from Amazon itself, especially during these lighting deals. He told me that such a great discount is offered only when the product is nearing its expiry which kind of worried me. Even I wondered, for a such a big discount, there has to be something wrong. Well, I just crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.Finally, the product arrived today. I ripped it open and first saw the mfg. date and it was July 2014! I was elated and immediately turned on my laptop to write about this. Thank you Amazon for the truly excellent packaging, service and delivery.Looking forward for such excellent deals.

Even the Royal canine is good, it was expensive and out of my budget so used it only till 3 months.Drools focus dosent show much results even at its premium price than a drools normal or pedigree. My rottie had skin allergies when using drools focus. I had only buy that seeing <30% meat in it and no grain or fillers. But turned out to be no good.So when shifted to pedigree allergies were gone slowly and my rottie looks wonderful now. Dont believe in ""corn as filler"" rumers, corn is actually beneficial for dogs as per recent studies.And if you want to feed your dog a raw meat diet then do it but opting a kibble which got a high meat content is actually useless and proves unworthy.Pedigree has been fed to millions of pets around the world safely.

106987.0,OMG! This product is either fake or of very bad quality. I am using Pedigree puppy for my pug from last 3 months when purchased from local shop but this time i gave a try and ordered online from Amazon and now my puppy hates it. She just smell and go away. This might be because this people can cheat humans but not dogs. It smells very bad and different from the original Pedigree which is available in local stores.I again bought from local shop and now she is eating as normal. So definitely this product is fake or faulty product which pedigree might have removed but this peoples are selling on Amazon.Request you to stay away or else you will loose money and health of your lovely dog.,amzn1.account.AFJNY75SS62SPKNMZZWGZGSSK3TA,Amazon Customer,Amazon India,RBFG2XTH4QHZL,1.0 out of 5 stars

107552.0,"1. i dont know about 5 signs of good health but this contains many of the micro and macro nutrients which is essential for a dog. supplementing this with some milk, and raw eggs cooked ragi.2. i bought this mainly because we had to cook ragi too often. this helps extend the frequency by which we cook ragi.3. its good enough. i like the smell. i can confidently say that if i were a dog i would be all over this.4. i ordered a 10kg pack. its particularly difficult to preserve the freshness for more than a month. pedigree should reinvent the way we use this. maybe give it an airtight flap in the bottom from which the food can be removed.5. feeding the dog only this would be a costly affair. hence we use half pedigree and half home made food like ragi.its a good product. i would recommend it to people who struggle to prepare food very frequently. helps you feed nutritious food for your best friend",amzn1.account.AHI2E6ZSNCN5DUXM65OZLI5HV73Q,Ighishi,Amazon India,R36IHR6P3J7Y0Y,4

107594.0,"My puppy died within a week of eating pedigree. She had a paw missig and i adopted her fm the street. She was happy with roti dal rice etc. Then i decided to treat her and bought pedigree. She puked on the first day of eating pedigree,..i didnt realise it was due to the pedigree that she was puking. For a two days she got weaker and stopped eating. Two days later i put her on curd rice which she started to eat. But in my excitement i again fed her pedigree.. the following day she puked and had thin stinky stool and developed partial parallysis. From there it was all down hill despite my prayers.. poor Nanhi died two days later after having struggled with a convulsing stomach all night, trying to puke even when there was nothing left.. iit has taken me two months to overcome the shock and write this review. This was because an emaciated kitten i was nursing fm a week ago also died after i fed him pedigree. It seems that this pedigree is a poison for young animals.

107767.0,"For some reason, my street pets don't enjoy eating it as much as I would have liked them to. It may have to do with the pellet size, which is bigger than Pedigree puppy, Pedigree Senior and Chappi. One can purchase a small pack before buying the bulk ones. Also, since it is one of the reasonably priced kibbles, there is compromise on the nutritional value. Contains more of fillers and less of meat (once again, those with higher meat content are costlier). Try not to feed it to your pet. They will do much better on home cooked food.

Seems like the feedback here really made them look into and fix the issues other reviewers and customers were having.Smells a little nauseating, but hey, it's dog food, what'd I expect?Store in an airtight container once opened, also, follow the serving instructions depending on your dog's age and breed. Overfeeding will result in a lot of health complications, so be careful there.

107927.0,"Hi,I have been using this Pedigree product for over two years now and regretting my lack of market research. This is the worst pet food you can give to any animal.Pedigree Dog Food and Pedigree Cat Food are exactly the same. It contains only Corn and Chemical Artificial Flavours. Neither the dog food nor the cat food of Pedigree contains any meat. It has no chicken, no meat, no ocean fish, no milk. All the products of Pedigree contain ONLY Corn and chemical flavours that fool your pet into eating it.Of course, if you do a simple little bit of study you will find that home made food is best for your dogs and cats and other pets. In case you have no choice, I would suggest Drools FOCUS Puppy Food which has real chicken and is lot more expensive than this corn food. Another option is Royal Canin but it has to be imported so it is even more expensive than Drools.Pedigree is widely advertised with family friendly and cute kids and furry animals on TV and other media. So people think this company cares about pets. They don't. They feed your pets corn and some by products like chicken feet, beak, animal hooves, and other remains which even a stray dog / cat would want to avoid.Think about it. If you buy One Kilo Chicken from your local slaughterhouse even in expensive Mumbai costs maximum Rs. 110. That is 100% chichen weighing One Kilo. Isn't that better than spending Rs. 1000 on corn flavoured to smell like chicken? If you love your pet, try the home made one. If you want emergency stock of pet food when you don't have time for preparing it at home, go for Drools Focus or Royal Canin.",amzn1.account.AFVFGVFOC6WUUL7VZ3ZSBDAFMPOA,Ujjwal Dey,Amazon India,R2LCHMYRJ6TLJR,1

107949.0,"Looking for the possibly worst food you can give to your puppy/dog, possibly worse than feeding him rice,egg,chapati on a daily basis? Well look no further.Ref:http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/pedigree.htmlRef: http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/pedigree-dog-food-dry/Well, I hope atleast 2-3 people read this and do themselves a favor.Pedigree, aka. the food which shows 6 signs of 'good' health more like 6 signs of tricking people into buying the productI have fed my puppy Pedigree for sometime, he was alright on it...just like a kid would be alright on cornflakes all day-night for a month or a year atmost..untill they start showing innumerable signs of bad health.They advertise the food containing Chicken and Veg...well that means there's gotta be loads of chicken and little bit of veggies too, right?Well let's take a look at the ingredients (reference given above) Ground whole grain corn, poultry by-product meal (source of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate), corn gluten meal, animal fat (source of omega 6 fatty acids [preserved with BHA & citric acid]), meat and bone meal (source of calcium), soybean meal, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, brewers rice, dried plain beet pulp, natural flavor, salt, calcium carbonate, potassium chloride, monocalcium phosphate, dried peas, vitamins (choline chloride, vitamin E supplement, niacin [vitamin B3], biotin, d-calcium pantothenate [source of vitamin B5], riboflavin supplement [vitamin B2], pyridoxine hydrochloride [vitamin B6], vitamin A supplement, vitamin B12 supplement, thiamine mononitrate [vitamin B1], vitamin D3 supplement), minerals (zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide), dried carrots, added color (red 40, yellow 5, blue 2), BHA & citric acid (a preservative)Where is chicken I'd ask, you'd probably say in the second ingredient poultry by-product meal... well that's nothing but literally the by-products of poultry i.e. anything except the meat..eg.Chicken feet, undeveloped eggs, chicken heads, their body parts(all of them)Keep in mind that they are written in a descending order (higher to lower), highest in corn..which is not even a vegetable but a grain...full of calories, part reason why most of large sized dogs (labs mostly) in India are obese.If you tell that your dog is just fine and eats the food crazily..well this review probably won't make sense to you but just imagine a kid eating kellogs/cornflakes like his staple meal. I advise trying to feed your dog only (in descending order) chicken,eggs and vegetables all boiled for a couple of weeks, preferably a month and compare his coat,joins,bowel movement after the time period is over and see the difference yourself.I can't believe this thing have 4.5 ratings from 350+ people",amzn1.account.AFK5OOSF6O7X6K22QTNQWEPQAPAQ,Riddhesh,Amazon India,R2T1NSMV43XJFO,1

108011.0,"Pedigree chicken and Veggies is the best dog food that you can give to your dog. Sure there are more refined/costlier foods available, but overall, and for daily usage, Pedigree is the most convenient option as per my choice.I tried Meat and Rice but my dog got fed up in a few days so coming back to this again. Also, meat and rice makes my dog's poop green which shouldnt normally be the case. This one bought his stool color back to normal in 3 days.I feed him pedigree in afternoon and night, boiled chicken and Rice in morning. And this seems to be a very good choice.

108036.0,"No market food is as healthy as your homemade food for your dog. Still in this fast life people generally don't have enough time. I myself give Pedigree to my lab. As far as Dog food is concern I've tried Royal canin (very expensive, so I ditched it) , Drool (the worst Dog food, buy only for your enemy's dog) and Pedigree. Overall Pedigree is fair and good among all the said brands, it's economical (not much, but we don't have options).As far as my lab's health is concern I found he's quite healthy, happy, shining coat after I started this.Still I don't feed him much market food and try to feed him on homemade food, if I want to give him something which is not homemade Pedigree is the one.

108501.0,"Worst dog food. I have given almost every dog food to my dog, but this is the worst dog food. Hair of my 11 month labrador become dull, he became lean and lazy after this. I have purchased 15 kg pack. I even doubt the genuineness of the product,  as the bag is just packed with thread. I have tried pedigree earlier also, but always got bad results. This is my last time, in future I will never give it my dog.According to my experience I must say that royal canin and drools focus are best. Even simple drools puppy food is also good. Bust royal canin is best of all. Royal canin is costly, but it is worth the price. It will improve the overall health, looks of your dog. Pedigree is just waste of money.

I received the item in a damaged condition with all ants and some insects cropping out of it through small holes. The reason for all these is the courier company the shipper/seller uses. The DELIVERY LOCATION of this item is EXACTLY 110 kms from sellers warehouse but the courier company shipped the item to Hyderabad which is 600Kms away and next travelled back to Anantapur and finally to my home town which took over 8 days.

109195.0,"The truth is I have not even once bought this from Amazon.in but use to buy it from a local vendor here in Meghalaya. I have witnessed a few months back where I use to feed my cats products other than whiskas and I see their development is very slow, but after feeding whiskas for 2 - 3 weeks I notice a lot of change in them, they are more active, happy and playful, their hair quality also changed dramatically from a dull appearance to a shiny, long and healthy one. Whiskas does a lot of good to my cats.I currently have 13 cats of different breed, the method I use when feeding them is that I use to take a cup full of whiskas in a bowl and pour one cup of boiling water over it and cover it leaving it till the boiling water is fully absorbed, them I mixed the now softened whiskas with one plate of rice. I feed them this  way twice a day also I have a separate bowl for giving them water so that they will not drink water from drains when they're thirsty.If you're planning to buy, go for it, I'm sure you'll beginning to see a lot of positive change in your cats. I hope this review is helpful to all you cat lovers out there. ..",amzn1.account.AGHFRRP3J77LMIZQASXWYXBZFIMQ,Paul Rynjah,Amazon India,R1SUTEY948TGQH,5

She does not seem overly excited about this meal but eats up nevertheless. The smell of this is less pungent than Meo. Whiskas seems to be more easily available online at all times. The lowest price that I have bought it at is Rs. 292. Very reasonably priced. To make it more exciting for kitty I add some liquid of the Whiskas Tuna in jelly wet meal to the dry food and Kitty loves to eat the soaked granules. The 1.1 Kg pack lasts for approximately 2 weeks in addition to two wet meals per week.

109346.0,"Your regular whiskas kitten kibble food.My kitten has been eating it since the time I got her. Cant exactly say she loves it, but am sure she doesnt complain. Being dry food, it is always better to complement it with wet food once or twice weekly. Providing fresh water is really important. Between this and other brand that my friend uses for his kitten, I have noticed a much better coat in mine. It can be genetic or from the food, cant really say. Also leaving it in the tray is a problem as it absorbs moisture readily and my kitten doesn't like it once it has taken moisture in. I would suggest you try plain dry food first and sprinkle water only if your kitten absolutely doesn't like the kibble as is. Overall a great product and value for money. As far as amazon is concerned, I got it during the Great Indian festival sale at a very good price.

109364.0,"Kitten loves it. Unfortunately, this dry format of cat food is not reccomended by experts as it contains good percentage carbohydrates, which can trigger obesity and later, diabetes in cats. Moreover, we also add water to the granules at times, make it soggy, force the kitten to drink fluid along with this food. Hydration of cats is a difficult task.

Also please do not directly switch 100% from the current food to Pedigree if you feed it for the first time. Start with 25% and increase it over a period of 7-10 days to 100%.

109999.0,"""Cats Know the Difference"" - I have 3 cats who have been feeding on 'Tuna in Jelly' packs and cans since 6 months.When I offered them with this food purchased from Amazon, they just smelled and turned away. None were ready to eat.What I noticed:1. Instead of Jelly, there was liquid in the can.  (Lets assume that, the jelly melted off due to Summer heat).2. That jelly didn't freeze back even after 2 days of refrigeration. Typically, the cans I purchase in a store near by, the jelly solidifies once i put it in AC room.3. The Tuna pieces were different - This was very much noticeable to my eyes.All my observations + the feedback from my cats = DONT BUY. I will not say this is a fake or whatever because, I don't know! My cats are not eating and your cats may not eat too because 'Cats know the difference'.============= Edit on 9th May 2017.Having said above, I wanted to add some more to this review.I got Same cans from my local store.  My cats ate a part of the can and i saved the rest for next session.  By then, all the jelly became liquid and then when i served it to my cats, they refused to eat.So, I learnt that, once the jelly in the can melts off, cats wont like the stuff.Unfortunately, in all the cans that I got from Amazon, the jelly is already in liquid state and I believe, that should be the reason they are not eating it.",amzn1.account.AGOEGESJ7IWYTUXYGMRROVKJDIWA,Ram Babu Gorre,Amazon India,R1VVDEVFQHY1OO,1.0 out of 5 stars

110149.0,"people who can give royal canin,  drools or any other brand, when you give this they will not eat, if you are givin this and later if you give drools they will not eat even of give egg in that, so better start chappi once the becomes 1 year, i have 3 rott and 1 great dane, and they are fully fit and super heavy in size, people who complaint about illness after giving this food that happens if you dont give proper time to time vaccine or sometimes they even eat some or the other thing outside when the owner is not watching, so we cannot blame any brand, each brand has thier uniqueness. overall chappi is budget food i buy 20 kg and it goes around 35 days for 3 rott.if your dog is weaker give 3 tea cups amount at a time, thirce a day.. that is 9 cups a day.. once the dog becomes super heavy make it 6 cups a day and the health level will be normal  even if you give 6 cups a day (only once the dog gets built up) if you have preganant female dog feed her 9 glaas a day, once the pups are born give at 8am 11am 1pm 4pm 8pm only 2 glass each time (for mother) you dont need to spend lots of money on royal canin because remember how a stray female dog does anything and gets her stomach filled by eating anything and gives milk to the puppy.",amzn1.account.AFWCUSSMG3T3IHEBPBQAW3P4WWFQ,ashwin sathe,Amazon India,RK0ZB0GNLWYGF,5.0 out of 5 stars

I have around 8 street puppies about a month or so and they love to dig into it along with their moma. Have used purepet in the past but had issues with dogs not liking it plus the size was too big for small puppies to crush and chew.My own Rottweiller loves to eat it.

110193.0,Pedigree combo comes with the regular puppy food which is dry and the pedigree gravy which is wet.The pedigree gravy has small chunks of what seems like chicken liver in a liquid. Puppy's love the smell of it and they will start jumping and wagging their tail.I have a German shepherd puppy and this is one of her favourite food.I mix it with pedigree dry food or white rice and she will eat more food when compare to her usual intake.I usually heat this up for 1 minute in microwave just to bring out some flavour which I prefer personally. The gravy can be given directly out of the pack without cooking/heating as well.Overall the Pedigree combo saves you money and the pedigree gravy can be a treat for your dog like a weekend meal/on a day when she does something really nice.,amzn1.account.AFY6EBKOQKSUPNH22JSWOSZ2N4GA,kannan,Amazon India,R1E06ORMNLQFFX,5

You can mix it with rice, can also give it with the dry food (adjust the portion size accordingly), chapatis, bread,eggs etc.The box contain 15 packets which don't require refrigeration if unopened.And lastly if you have a senior dog like mine, introduce the food in small portions.Thanks for reading the review.",amzn1.account.AEUS7YSMKZQA6V6NWPOND6M7WUAA,mansi mudgal,Amazon India,R14WY1DBDLPYOH,5.0 out of 5 stars

It is expensive to give on a daily basis but the quality seems really good. I had ordered the tuna one and this was shipped to me instead. Though this mistake worked out well for me this time, it happened for two orders and I requested to replace one. I wonder why adequate care is not taken and the correct item ordered is shipped to the customer? Careless attitude. I read in other reviews too that they faced similar mix ups.

111051.0,"The tins are really tiny, as small as a medium size tomato! Kitty ate the contents in two sittings though. She did not like the prawns (there were many of these pieces in the first tin) and kept them for eating last. Everything around them she ate and relished. Eventually, after it just sat in her bowl for hours she ate it when she was really hungry. In the second tin, the dark brown pieces, which I assume are the prawns  (as seen in the shared picture),  were significantly less and so she ate it up in one go! Why the manufacturer cannot maintain consistency in all the tins?This wet meal is really expensive feed on a daily basis. I got it at a deal price of Rs.210. Arrived in time and well packed. Only there was a mix up, again! The chicken one was sent instead of the tuna & prawns, which got a replaced later. Negligence? deliberate? I don't know but I infer from other reviews that this mix up is routine and happens often! it happened to me twice. Utmost care should be taken to ship the right product to the customer.Verdict: 4 stars for the product and 2 star for customer satisfaction.Thanks for reading!",amzn1.account.AHFEMTCLKXQDWQ256UMFIQ6LTFDA,Kiran,Amazon India,RVLZUMF2UWVXZ,4

Because of this we don't give her things that she won't eat straight away to avoid any incidents with our children. That's how I know these treats must be really tasty, she ate it straight away! I'm really pleased to have found something tempting enough for her to devour immediately that we can reward her with.This is the first raw hide type treat we have given her that she hasn't just sat on for a few days...it took her a good 10-15 minutes to get through so good for her teeth and it was nice to see her enjoying something for more than a split second...Having said that I would still recommend these treats, I think they are a little on the expensive side but they are made from almost all nice and natural ingredients and make an ideal occasional treat/reward.",amzn1.account.AEQRYFSSX35ZFP64C2CHBDYS7WMA,SwordFish,Amazon India,RVKZZTQUZET5E,5

112935.0,Please donot give it to your pet! I dont need to but I am going to caution you that it doesnt contain wholesome chicken but it contains chicken wastes and yes the dogs love to gulp it down and it May seem to be a big relief for the owners that their pet is well fed but my dog had specs of blood in his poo whenever we would feed it to him. I know this AS as soon as we stopped giving it to him there was nothing wrong with his poo and we were sure of it as we were not giving him anything else except for this with chapati . Also he had been dewormed according to strict schedule with the vet.We then moved on to homemade boiled chicken with chapati and yes the blood had completely vanished.

I know this AS as soon as we stopped giving it to him there was nothing wrong with his poo and we were sure of it as we were not giving him anything else except for this with chapati . Also he had been dewormed according to strict schedule with the vet.We then moved on to homemade boiled chicken with chapati and yes the blood had completely vanished.

I check my cart frequently to track the price changes and order when the deal is right. it gets featured in lightning deals mostly  in the beginning of the months.The pricing depends on a lot of things like taxes , inflation etc and so they change.

The best part is it has no odor, is premium quality and the nutritional effects are visible in the way of a shinier softer coat. Yes, it is also a bit pricier than other options but it's also more worth it. I like that the kitten food also has milk pockets so there is a variation in taste. No other brand has this. My kittens seem to be addicted to it lol, it's gobbled up in seconds. I just hope they start making one in a larger volume pack.

This is the third review for Whiskas products so I don't have anything more to say except if you have spoiled kitties who won't eat rice and daal anymore, then you need to get them Whiskas :)Seriously though, a big benefit is that this dry food can stay in the bowl for days, and it is still a fresh enough taste for the cats to enjoy.

And what adds fuel to the fire is the behaviour of delivery guys rude.. They don't deliver at home rather they have started choosing famous place in locality and order the customers to come and take it from there.. And then they argue.. Is this the service you guys provide?humble request.. Make sure you deliver things properly otherwise you guys are gonna suffer huge losses with dissatisfied customers not asking for any service in future...
