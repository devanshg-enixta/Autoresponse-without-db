A gentle wipe with a damp cotton ball will help to keep your dog's eyes gunk-free. Wipe outward from the corner of the eye and be careful not to touch his eyeball-you don't want to scratch the cornea. If your dog constantly suffers from runny eyes and discharge, please see your veterinarian. Your pet may have an infection.
