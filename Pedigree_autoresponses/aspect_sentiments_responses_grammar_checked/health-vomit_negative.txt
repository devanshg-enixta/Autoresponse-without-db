Vomiting can be caused due to several reasons such as lethargy & depression, abdominal pain, decreased urination, if it's a puppy please take to the vet immediately, else for an adult dog monitor carefully and if the vomit continues to happen visit the vet.
that time, offer a small amount of water. If your dog can hold that down, gradually reintroduce larger amounts of water.
