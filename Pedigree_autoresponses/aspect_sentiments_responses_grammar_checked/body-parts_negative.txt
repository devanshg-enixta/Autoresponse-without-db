 I would suggest you to select which type of food will suit your dog. Here are few guidelines:- Your dog's calorie and nutrient requirements are based on his body weight, his age, his physiological state (growing, pregnant or lactating?) and his activity level. First select the right type of food for his lifestyle, then weigh your dog (don't guess) and feed according to the feeding guide provided with the food. It is, however, important to remember that all dogs are individuals and feeding guides are recommendations only. So, most importantly, monitor your dog's body condition and weight regularly, adjusting the amount you are feeding to ensure that body weight and condition are optimum so that he is neither losing nor gaining weight.
