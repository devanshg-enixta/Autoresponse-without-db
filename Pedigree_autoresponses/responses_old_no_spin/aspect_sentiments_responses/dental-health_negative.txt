As food is always not the reason behind the health issues especially dental, one of the reasons can be as dog mouth do not contain bugs which are responsible for caries in man and also Dogs saliva is alkaline and has less amylase enzyme and more urea (that digest sugars) in saliva (when compare to man) How ever plaque and gums diseases are very common in dogs. Regular feeding of oral chews like dentastix also recommended for preventing dental plaque or tartar
Please keep one thing in mind that occasional feeding of snacks/treats like ice creams or cakes cause no harm as long as they do not contribute to more than 15 % of his energy requirement/food intake.
