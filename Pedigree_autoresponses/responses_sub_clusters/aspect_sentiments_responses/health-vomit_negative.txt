Vomiting serves a vital function in dogs, many of whom have a well-deserved reputation for eating just about anything. Throwing up can be the bodyâ€™s way of correcting a mistake. Please consult a vet, it can be a serious problem.
If your adult dog (not applied to puppies, please take puppies to the doctor as soon as possible) has only vomited once or twice and seems to feel pretty good,take away all sources of food and water for six to eight hours. If your dog does not vomit during that time, offer a small amount of water. If your dog can hold that down, gradually reintroduce larger amounts of water.
Vomiting can be caused due to several reason such as lethargy & depression, abdominal pain, decreased urination, if its a puppy please take to the vet immediately, else for a adult dog monitor carefully and if the vomit continues to happen visit the vet.
