Please take care of your pet's stomach. At pedigree, we go through intensive tests and processes before launching the product, the bad stomach might be due to some other things.
Some pet parents offer their pets human Pepto-bismol or Famotidine (Pepcid) for an upset tummy. These over the counter drugs can be safe, if administered minimally, at the proper dose. Be sure to ask your vet what the dosage should be for your dog.
